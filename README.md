# TITLE: ExpenseReimbursementSystem
Description: A Java Full Stack Application to Manage Employee Expense Reimbursements

The Expense Reimbursement System allows employees and managers to submit and process reimbursement requests for expenses that are incurred during company time. 
An employee account type is able to submit a new request via an HTML webpage form and submit the information, which is then persisted to a database. They are also able to view all of their prior requests and also filter past submitted requests by their status: "Pending", "Approved" or "Denied".
A manager account type is able to resolve requests via an request table that is dynamically generated by DOM manipulation.
