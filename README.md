# Expense Reimbursement System

## Project Description
The Expense Reimbursement System allows employees and managers to submit and process reimbursement requests for expenses that are incurred during company time. 
An employee account type can submit a new request via an HTML webpage form and submit the information, which is then persisted to a database. They are also able to view all their prior requests and also filter past submitted requests by their status: "Pending", "Approved" or "Denied".
A manager account type is able to resolve requests via a request table that is dynamically generated by DOM manipulation.
